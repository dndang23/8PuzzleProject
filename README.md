The project uses the pygame module to create an enjoyable 3-by-3 slider puzzle game. The goal of the game is to arrange in the numbers in 
numerical ascending order and finish the puzzle with the least moves and fastest time. During the process of playing a puzzle, the player can pause the game
to take a break solving the puzzle, restart the puzzle, or play a new puzzle. Once the player finishes a puzzle, the player can either play the same puzzle
agan to improve their score or decide to play a different puzzle. If the player is struggling with a puzzle, the player can click the solver button to allow the 
computer solve the puzzle using the A* algorithm. The player can then either replay the same puzzle or request for a different puzzle.

To play the game, simply enter the "venv" directory and run the file "BoardVisualizer.py".

Enjoy!
